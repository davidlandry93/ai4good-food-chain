## The problem

Moisson Montréal is a little miracle in itself: it distributes 15,6 millions of kg of food anually to people in need.
Unfortunately, such a volume of food makes the logistics a difficult problem.
This can lead to food waste, due for instance to unexpected high volumes of perishable products.

## Concept

This exploratory data analysis aims to give more confidence to food ban supply chain managers at Moisson Montréal.
With a better access to their own data, as well as predictive models for food donations, we are confident that AI can help Moisson Montréal avoid food waste while still providing for those in need.
